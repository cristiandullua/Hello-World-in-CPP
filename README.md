# Overview

Welcome to my C++ hello world project!

In this project, my goal as a software engineer is to further my learning by gaining hands-on experience with C++, a powerful and widely-used programming language. 
The software I have created is a simple "Hello, World!" program that serves as an introduction to the language and its syntax.

My purpose for creating this software is to become more familiar with C++ and to gain a better understanding of its concepts and capabilities. 
By completing this project, I hope to improve my problem-solving skills, become more comfortable with the tools and frameworks used in the development process, 
and deepen my understanding of programming concepts.


Thank you for taking the time to check out my project!

# Development Environment

For this project, I used a few different tools to develop my C++ hello world program. Firstly, I used a code editor called Visual Studio Code, which provides a lightweight, cross-platform editing environment for a variety of programming languages. I also used the MinGW GCC compiler to compile and run my C++ code on my Windows machine.

In addition to these tools, I used the C++ programming language to write my "Hello, World!" program. C++ is a popular programming language that is widely used for system programming, embedded systems, and game development, among other applications. It is a high-level language that provides powerful features such as classes, templates, and operator overloading, and is known for its performance and efficiency.
